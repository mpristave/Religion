EVTNAME2000099;The Temple of Crime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000099;In $YEAR$, at a temple on top of a hill, famous for its library and the collection of books that it houses, a series of murders of monks took place, enveloped in a cloud of mystery. A foreign holy man, well known for his insight and scholarship, was summoned to solve the crimes and find who was behind the assassinations. In centuries to come, the place survived under the name of the Temple of Crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000099;A mystery of the Middle Ages;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000101;After the second murder of a monk, I continue my findings. Last night, I followed through the temple a shadowy figure, who went to the library and grabbed a book which the last murdered was copying. Both that and the first dead were suspected to have contra-natura physical contact, but more interesting is that both read the same book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000101;Continue investigating;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000102;After the second murder of a monk, I continue my findings. Last night, I followed through the temple a shadowy figure, who went to the library and grabbed a book which the last murdered was copying. Both that and the first dead were suspected to have contra-natura physical contact. I wonder what can that mean, if something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000102;This doesn't look good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLA2000102;The day after, [This.GetFirstName] was found dead: the third cadaver to stench the temple's walls. The mystery would then remain hooded after three more deaths, as an inquisitor went to investigate and an old heretic who hid at the temple was put to the stake. The real murderer will never be known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000104;I have continued my findings. All this affair has to do with some obscure book or collection of books guarded in a secret section of the library. Someone wants to prevent them for being read. In the event of a new murder, Bernardo Gui, of the Holy Inquisition, has arrived in the temple to conduct his own investigation and make judgement if it's due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000104;Continue investigating;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB2000104;Better not mess with an inquisitorial envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLB2000104;[From.GetFirstName] will withdraw from the temple. Bernardo Gui will follow on, and an old heretic who hid at the temple will be executed accused of the murders. But the real killer will forever remain in mystery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000105;I have continued my findings, but to no avail. Whoever is responsible of the murders, knows how to hide himself well. In the event of a new murder, Bernardo Gui, of the Holy Inquisition, has arrived in the temple to conduct his own investigation and make judgement in case. The abbot has asked me to withdraw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000105;No point in continuing then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLA2000105;[From.GetFirstName] will abandon the investigation. Bernardo Gui will follow on, and an old heretic who hid at the temple will be executed accused of the murders. But the real killer will forever remain in mystery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000107;Even risking an accusation of heresy by confronting an inquisitor's verdict, I plan to enter the secret library tonight. I know the murderer is the venerable Jorge, the oldest of the brothers. The volume which is source of all the crimes is the thought to be long-lost Second poetry book of Aristotle. The mad old man has deemed the book a dangerous reading for any pious man: comedy makes laughter, laughter kills fear, and without fear there can not be Faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000107;The mystery is to be unsolved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME2000108;Showdown at the Secret Library;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000108;The clues left by the old brother and the riddles to solve to find and confront him made [From.GetFirstName] end the investigation in the secret library. The old man, after being discovered, tried to escape through the labyrinth which took to the place. In the chase that followed, a fire broke out. only [From.GetFirstName] survived. The second poetry book of Aristotle burned along with which was probably one of the greatest collection of knowledge from Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000108;A legend to be remembered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLA2000108;Centuries later, the name of the temple and the holy man who solved the mystery would be immortalized. But who can imagine it right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2000109;The clues left by the old brother and the riddles to solve to find and confront him made [From.GetFirstName] end the investigation in the secret library. All we could know is that a fire broke out and  [From.GetFirstName] died. Only cinders of the bodies and the library remained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA2000109;A story to be forgotten;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLA2000109;The true murderer will forever remain in mystery. Bernardo Gui concluded that [From.GetFirstName] was in fact the assassin and so perished while trying to hide his crimes, even knowing that he arrived in the temple after the first murder. No one will discuss the verdict. So sadly ends the story of the Temple of Crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
