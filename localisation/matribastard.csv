EVTDESCmb301;While it is true that [From.GetFirstName] is not my husband's child, there can be no doubt that [From.GetSheHe] is mine. I am determined that [From.GetSheHe] will carry on my dynasty even if [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] will not acknowledge [From.GetHerHim]. After all, by our marriage contract all children are of my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmb301;Try to convince [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] that he is the father.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmb301;I don't care about his opinion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmb302;While it is true that [From.GetFirstName] is not my husband's child, there can be no doubt that [From.GetSheHe] is mine. If [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] can not be persuaded to legitimize [From.GetHerHim], then [From.GetSheHe] will carry on my dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAmb305;For the good of the realm, I shall treat [From.GetHerHim] as my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCmb306;My wife [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is openly declaring that [From.GetTitledFirstName] is not my child, and will be of her dynasty, regardless of my wishes, declaring it is her right based on our marriage contract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmb306;That arrogant bitch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmb308;My wife is asking me to either acknowledge her bastard as my own child, or she will publicly humiliate me by publicly declaring the child a bastard, legitimating it as one of her heirs, and giving it her family name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmb308;For... for the good of the realm, dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmb308;That bitch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
