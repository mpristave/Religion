#monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul. It is a byproduct of the theological School of Alexandria, which began its Christological analysis with the eternal Son, the Word of God made flesh, and sought to explain how this eternal Word had come to Earth as a man. Monophysites claim that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, had only a single nature which was either divine or a synthesis of divine and human. Monophysitism was condemned by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, in which the Definition of Chalcedon, which maintains that Christ maintained one divine nature and one human nature after the Incarnation, was adopted. The Chalcedonian settlement encountered strong resistance in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, leading ultimately to the schism of the Oriental Orthodox churches. The Monophysite Church took root where Local kings were trying to differentiate themselves from the official Roman church, mainly in the Caucasus and Aegyptus. The Monophysite Church thrived and organised itself in these distant locations. Monophysites have developed their own rites and use clearly differentiated divine liturgies and iconographies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

miaphysite_DESC;Miaphysitism is a Mainstream Christian denomination of Clerical soul. It is a byproduct of the theological School of Alexandria, which began its Christological analysis with the eternal Son, the Word of God made flesh, and sought to explain how this eternal Word had come to Earth as a man. Monophysites claim that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Word of God, had divinity and humanity united in one nature, the two being united without separation, without confusion, and without alteration. Miaphysitism was condemned by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE, in which the Definition of Chalcedon, which maintains that Christ maintained one divine nature and one human nature after the Incarnation, was adopted. The Chalcedonian settlement encountered strong resistance in the Eastern fringes of the Roman Empire, leading ultimately to the schism of the Oriental Orthodox churches.

#in effort to fix the monophysite description
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is a heretical Christian denomination of Clerical soul. It is the Christological position that, after the union of the divine and the human in the historical Incarnation, Jesus Christ, as the incarnation of the eternal Son or Word of God, had only a single "nature" which was either divine or a synthesis of divine and human. Historically, Monophysitism (usually capitalized in this sense) refers primarily to the position of those (especially in Egypt and to a lesser extent Syria) who rejected the Council of Chalcedon in 451 (the Fourth Ecumenical Council). The moderate members of this group, however, maintained a "Miaphysite" theology that became that of the Oriental Orthodox churches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#3 addion Tengri-Norse. Formed when tengri control norse territory
tengri_norse_DESC;The worship of Thor Tangr ( "Celestial Thor" ) is a Local Steppe belief of Statist soul, with significant Norse influences. It combines the worship of Gokh Tanri, the Turkic sky god, with the Norse sky diety Thor. Thor Tangr is seen as the father of the Valkyries who brings rightous men to Valhalla where they will live among the gods including the god who created reality, Odin. The faith has a simple clergy system, featuring priests who mostly tend to congregation members and shrine maintenance, and shamans, who perform mystical rites to gain access to a higher plane of existence from where they can consult Thor Tangr himself on how best to fulfill his holy wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tengri_norse_reformed_DESC;The worship of Odinism is a Mainstream Steppe faith of Statist soul, with strong Barbarian influences. It is a reformed Tengriist faith and places Odin back in his role as the chief god and Thor Tangr in the role as savior of mankind. Thor watches over man using a pure, white goose that flies constantly over an endless expanse of the earth. An established scripture of Sagas in the runic script tells of Odins role as creator of the universe and mankind and Thor and his daughters the Valkyries leading rightious men to heaven. All other gods in the faith are considered lesser dieties but are still venerated. Due to steppe influence horses are considered almost sacred animals and horsemanship is prized. The roles of shamans and priests have been combined into a single hierarchical priesthood of which is led by a high priest. One of the greatest virtues in this faith is bravery in battle, death in battle being able to redeem any soul. As a result the coming of this religion may bring about unprecidented heathen aggression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
